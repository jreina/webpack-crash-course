# webpack-crash-course

## What this is  
The source that I ended up with after going through the [Traversy Media Webpack Crash Course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lziuNMk_8eQ). The video is a bare-bones Webpack tutorial and overview which shows a basic Webpack config with the CSS and Babel loaders.
